# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update branding to “Aspen Clinic Snap” and complete the photo viewing/comparison/annotation workflow for locally stored session photos.

**Planned changes:**
- Rename the app everywhere in the UI to “Aspen Clinic Snap” (browser tab title, loading/empty text, header branding alt text, and default clinic name in Settings).
- Make session photos expandable from the session grid into a full-screen viewer with touch-friendly zoom/pan and a clear close action returning to the session.
- Add a Before/After comparison view for the current patient/session with a slider (swipe-reveal) mode and English labels/instructions.
- Expose photo annotation tools (pen, highlight, text) in the photo viewer, with the ability to add/edit/delete annotations and persist/reload them for the same photo.

**User-visible outcome:** The app displays the new “Aspen Clinic Snap” name, users can open any session photo full-screen to zoom/pan and annotate it, and they can compare two photos via a Before/After slider—without uploading photos to any backend.
