  "architectural_notes": [
    "Target platform: iPad (iOS); prototype first (single-screen) with patient list, photo viewer, and before/after comparison.",
    "UI direction: clean clinical minimal; white + soft teal palette; large touch targets for clinical/glove use; support portrait and landscape.",
    "Data/privacy constraint: store photos locally on-device only unless user exports; add app-open lock (Face ID/PIN).",
    "Treatment tagging should support editing after save and allow multi-select (multiple treatment tags per session and/or per photo).",
    "Consider capture-assist UX additions (alignment guides + optional view templates) to improve shot consistency for before/after comparisons.",
